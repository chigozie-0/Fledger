Want to commit your changes? Follow these simple instructions, and your code will end up on the main branch!

1. Add and commit your changes to your current branch, then push the changes to the origin of your branch.
   (Example used with the branch titled "Freddie")

   git add ..
   git commit -m "Commit Message"
   git push origin Freddie

2. Now create a merge request in GitLab.

3. Go to Code and select "Merge Requests."

4. Select "New Merge Request."

5. Make sure "main" is the target branch and select the source branch to be the one you made your changes to.
   Click "Compare Branches and Continue."

6. Assign yourself as an assignee and add someone else as a reviewer.
   MAKE SURE to deselect "Delete Source Branch" (This will delete your branch if you don't select it).
   Click "Create Merge Request."

If you ever want to get the most updated version of the app, input the following commands into the terminal.
(MAKE SURE to commit your changes locally BEFORE doing so, "Freddie" is the example branch)

git checkout Freddie
git pull origin main
